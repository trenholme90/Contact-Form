Steps to view:

1.) To view production ready code, from the root of the project, start a server from localhost. (See difference in webpack dev and prod files)
2.) To view in development, delete the dist folder in the root of the project and run 'npm run dev' from the command line. Again, start a server from localhost within the root of the project.
3.) After making changes, ensure to run 'npm run build' to bundle it for production.

Thanks for taking a look at this code. JT.
